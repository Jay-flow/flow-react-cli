## About flow-react-cli

This CLI program is a package that creates the boilerplate and components needed to develop React.
Using flow-react-cli, you can increase the productivity of React.

The two main features of this CLI program are as follows:

1. Create a React or Next.js project that has completed the installation and setup of the Typescip, EsLint, Prettier, and CSS libraries (styled-components or Tailwind CSS).
2. When you create a functional component page, you can create a page where the boilerplate was created.

## ðŸ“¢ Notes

> This program was inspired by [dooboo-cli](https://github.com/dooboolab/dooboo-cli) and created by referring to the code in the dooboo-cli.

> 4. When creating a project or component, there is no restriction on

I am working hard to develop this package with affection.
I check all the requests and issues.
I'm not a JavaScript developer. There are many parts of this package that are lacking.

This package needs your help.

Please write about the code and if you have a better code, please revise it and contribute.

Please upload the idea or bug for package function development on the [issue](https://github.com/Jay-flow/flow-react-cli/issues).

I like all discussions related to development because I am in a learning position.
